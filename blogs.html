       <div><p class="fs-4">Question:1) What is the difference among var , const and let?</p>
        <p class="fs-4">Answer: The scope of a var variable is functional scope.It can be updated and re-declared into the scope.It can be updated and re-declared into the scope. <br> The scope of a const variable is block scope.It cannot be updated or re-declared into the scope. It cannot be declared without initialization. <br> The scope of a let variable is block scope.It can be updated but cannot be re-declared into the scope. It can be declared without initialization.</p></div>

        <div class="fs-4"><p>Question:2) What is the difference between Regular function and Arrow function?</p>
        <p>Answer : Regular functions created using function declarations or expressions are constructible and callable. Since regular functions are constructible, they can be called using the new keyword. However, the arrow functions are only callable and not constructible,arrow functions can never be used as constructor functions.Arrow functions are best for callbacks or methods like map,reduce or forEach .Arrow functions are best for callbacks or methods like map , reduce , or forEach .</p></div>

        <div class="fs-4"><p> Question:3) What is the difference among Filter, Find, forEach and map?</p>
       <p>Answer : Filter checks every element in an array to see if it meets a certain criteria and returns a new array with the elements that return truthy for the criteria. <br>find is also a search function like the previous but they differ in one small detail â€” this function returns only one match in an array. If in an array is more than one result, the function will return the first that has matched. <br> forEach is used to execute the same code on every element in an array but does not change the array and it returns undefined. <br>
       map executes the same code on every element in an array and returns a new array with the updated elements. </p></div>
